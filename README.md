## Here's what I'm learning in Ruby!

### Variables
Convention in Ruby is to name variables with underscores, not camelCase. 

Example: my_new_variable = 'Hello World!'

### Print and Puts
The Print command will print something to the screen.
The Puts command prints something to the screen and adds a new line after it.

Ex: print 'hello world'
    print 'hello again' --> 

    hello worldhello again

Ex: puts 'hello world' 
    print 'hello again' -->

    hello world
    hello again
